                    My name is Daniel McKee, a 2nd year Web and Mobile Computing Major

                    and I'm on the RIT Halo Esports team. I have 4 cats, all of which 
                    are crazy. As I am from Buffalo, I am a huge fan of the Buffalo 
                    Bills and Buffalo Sabres sports teams (Brighter days on the 
                    horizon I hope.) My Spotify wrapped says Indie Rock is my #1 
                    genre but I tend to float around a bit. I am very appreciative 
                    of my Team iHold teammates which are a great group of people who 
                    would never back down and never give up.

                    Hello, I'm Nolan, a second-year web and mobile computing major at 
                    Rochester Institute of Technology and the lead developer of this 
                    site. I am on the ski team. I'm from Mount Laurel, NJ, where my 
                    family has six dogs(Faith, Bailey, Chase, Buddy,  Chubbs, Jupiter), 
                    and I have my cat(Chaz) at school with me. I'm a huge Eagles fan, 
                    and I am just eagerly waiting for February. I like to hang out with 
                    friends, ski, watch TV, go to the gym, & listen to music, mostly 
                    Classic Rock, but I also listen to Country, Pop, and rap. Finally, 
                    I'm incredibly grateful for my iHold Teammates, who always did their 
                    share of the work and kept in touch throughout the semester.

                    horror movies (even though I’m so easily scared) and love finding 
                    something new to watch. I’ve had a great time this semester with 
                    my team iHold members, I find we’ve worked well together and I 
                    think our work shows we pushed for something more than run-of-the-mill.
